# OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT 

A Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) company entered into the instant noodles business two

years back. Their higher management has noticed that there is a mismatch in the demand and

supply. Where the demand is high, supply is pretty low and vice-versa which results in a loss in

inventory cost and ultimately loss to the company. Hence, the higher management wants to

optimize the supply quantity in each and every warehouse in the entire country.

# GOALS

The objective of this exercise is to build a model, using historical data that will determine an

optimum weight of the product to be shipped each time from the respective warehouse.

1. Focus on all steps of data science (EDA, data processing, model, evaluation, charts)

2. Highlight any trend in data, deep insight, novel steps that you take

3. Highlight next steps and improvements.

4. Apply 5 to 6 machine learning algorithms and evaluate it.




# Supply Chain Management
Supply chain management (SCM) is the centralized management of the flow of goods and services to and from a company and includes all of the processes involved in transforming raw materials and components into final products

## Steps involved in acheiving the goal

### Step 1: Analysising the problem 
Studying the Problem in detail and finding out the goal of the project.


### Step 2: Data Collection 
Loading the necessary dataset for the model development

### Step 3 : Data analysis
Analysis of different aspects of dataset like info,shape,etc.. 

### Step 4 : Data Cleaning and Preprocessing 
evaluation of the dataset and cleaning the dataset which includes removing unwanted columns,replacing null values,

### Step 5 : Data Visualisation
Visualisation of each features in the dataset and evaluating how they are related to each other.Also finding their influence in developing the machine learning model.Features are visualised using histogram,bar plot .

### Step 6 : Feature selection
Filtering out the necessary features that are needed for the model and removing the rest.
This is done with the help of correlation matrix, boxplot and violin polt

### Step 7 : Encoding categorical features
To build a machine learning model all the features should numerical type. So ,using One Hot Encoding all categorical features are converted into numerical .

### Step 8 : Train -test spliting 
Splitting the dataset into 4 datasets containing independent training features, depending target training set , independent testing features and dependent target training set respectively.

### Step 9 : Model selection
Selection of suitable machine learning algorithms based on the goal of  project.

### Step 10 :Model development 
 Creating machine learning algorithms and evaluating their accuracy using different measures such as mean square error,root mean  square error, r2 score and mean absolute error.

### Step 11 : Conclusion
Based on the accuracy of each machine learning algorithms the best fit model was choosen .
